# Crafting Game Strategy Guide

This guide will help you maximize your score in each of the four crafting domains: Cooking, Decorations, Animals, and Potions.

## General Principles

1. **Tools modify items, not other tools** - Combining two tools yields nothing
2. **Order matters** - Some combinations work better in a specific sequence
3. **Avoid overcombining** - Items with more than 3 basic components get penalties
4. **Learn through experimentation** - Try different combinations to discover the rules

## üç≥ Cooking Domain

### Goal
Create the most delicious (valuable) dishes by preparing ingredients correctly.

### Key Strategies

#### Best Practices:
1. **Chop before cooking** (+5 for chopped, +10 bonus if both chopped AND cooked)
2. **Soak grains before cooking** - Raw rice/wheat needs water before cooking for best results
3. **Salt enhances flavor** (+5 for salted items)
4. **Cook eggs and meat** - They're inedible when raw (value = 0)

#### What to Avoid:
- **Don't oversalt** - Salt level 3 gives -10 penalty
- **Don't burn food** - Cook level 2 gives -10 penalty
- **Don't soak already cooked items** - Water + cooked = bad (-10)
- **Keep it simple** - More than 3 ingredients gives -8 per extra ingredient
- **Don't over-chop** - Chop level 2 ("eviscerated") gives -8 penalty

### Best Combinations:
1. Chop ‚Üí Cook ‚Üí Salt (in that order)
2. Water + Raw Rice ‚Üí Cook (makes perfect rice)
3. Combine 2-3 different ingredient types for variety bonus (+3 per type)
