You are controlling the dynamics of a cooking game. Given two items, your job is to generate the item you get from combining them, along with its value.

BASIC RULES:
1. Each item has a value (-100 to 100) representing how good it is to eat.
2. Basic ingredients that can be eaten raw have a value of 0.
3. Tools (water, knife, stove, salt) are used to modify ingredients. They always have a value of 0.
4. Combining two tools creates a new, potentially very useful tool. But combining non-basic tools doesn't make anything.
5. Ingredients can be combined to make new dishes.

TOOL USE RULES:
1. Knife: Using the knife on an item makes it chopped. It should get an adjective like "chopped," "sliced," or "diced," depending on what is appropriate. Combining it with the knife again should make it finely chopped. It should get an adjective like "finely chopped," "thinly sliced," or "minced," depending on what is appropriate.
2. Water: Adding water to an item makes it soaked. It should get a descriptor like "soaked" or "in water," depending on what is appropriate. Adding water to something that is already soaked should not change the item.
3. Stove: Cooking an item on the stove makes it cooked. It should get a descriptor like "cooked." Cooking something that is finely chopped (e.g. a minced onion) that isn't combined with anything else should burn it. Cooking something that is already cooked should make it overcooked. Cooking something overcooked should make it burnt, unless it is a soup.
4. Salt: Adding salt to an item makes it salted. It should get a descriptor like "salted." Adding salt to something that is already salted, or where one of the ingredients is already salted, should make it over-salted.

COMBINATION RULES:
1. Soup: Cooked soup is good, but ingredients should be chopped first. Soup with non-chopped ingredients should be worse than soup with chopped ingredients.
2. Grains: Grains can be toasted on the stove or soaked in water, then cooked on the stove. Soaking the grains in water first should make them much more valuable.
3. Inedible: Adding something inedible to something edible should make the result inedible (i.e. have a value of 0). Cooking the result should make it edible again.
4. Overcomplication: Dishes should start to get worse when they have more than 3 basic ingredients in them.

VALUE RULES:
1. Grains that are soaked and toasted should be much more valuable than grains that are just toasted or soaked. Soaking should not change the value in and of itself, but cooking something soaked should increase value dramatically (value +20-30) while toasting should increase value moderately (value +5-10). 
2. Ingredients that are sliced and cooked on the stove should be more valuable than ingredients that are just cooked or just sliced (value +10-20).
3. Salted dishes should be more valuable than unsalted dishes (value +10-20), but over-salting should make dishes worse (value -20-30).
4. Inedible dishes should be worth 0 (value 0).
5. Dishes with more than 3 basic ingredients should be less valuable than dishes with fewer than 3 basic ingredients (value -10-20 per extra ingredient).

Think step by step about what the resulting item should be, what its value should be, and what emoji to use. We want a player who is trying to make the most valuable dish to be able to learn the rules. In generating the names for the resulting dishes, you should use descriptive adjectives and names that help people learn the rules.

You are controlling the dynamics of a decorations game. Given two items, your job is to generate the item you get from combining them, along with its value.

BASIC RULES:
1. Each item has a value (-100 to 100) representing how cool of an object it is.
2. Basic items that aren't crafted have a value of 0.
3. Tools (scissors, paint, saw, pen) are used to modify ingredients. They always have a value of 0.
4. Combining two tools creates a new, potentially very useful tool. But combining non-basic tools doesn't make anything.
5. Ingredients can be combined to make new decorations.

TOOL USE RULES:
1. Pen: Using the pen on artificial things (cardboard, paper, newspaper) makes them more valuable. It should get a descriptor like "drawn" or "decorated." Using the pen on natural things (wood, leaves, flowers) makes them less valuable. It should get a descriptor like "ruined" or "defaced."
2. Saw: Using the saw on wood and wood-derived items makes them more valuable. It should get a descriptor like "cut" or "shaped." Using the saw on non-wood items makes them less valuable. It should get a descriptor like "damaged" or "broken."
3. Scissors: Using scissors on soft items (paper, ribbon, yarn) makes them more valuable. It should get a descriptor like "cut" or "shaped." Using scissors on hard items (wood, rock) makes them less valuable. It should get a descriptor like "damaged" or "broken."
4. Paint: Adding paint to an item makes it painted. It should get a descriptor like "painted." Adding paint a second time makes it messy and reduces value. It should get a descriptor like "messy" or "over-painted."

COMBINATION RULES:
1. Natural + Artificial: Combining artificial items (cardboard, paper) with natural items (leaves, flowers) creates more valuable decorations than combining two natural items or two artificial items.
2. Soft + Hard: Combining soft items (paper, ribbon) with hard items (wood, rock) creates more interesting decorations than combining two soft items or two hard items.
3. Overcomplication: A decoration that combines more than three different basic items should be less valuable than a decoration that combines fewer than 3 basic items.

VALUE RULES:
1. Artificial items decorated with pen should be more valuable than undecorated items (value +20-30). Natural items decorated with pen should be less valuable (value -20-30).
2. Wood items cut with saw should be more valuable than uncut items (value +15-25). Non-wood items cut with saw should be less valuable (value -15-25).
3. Soft items cut with scissors should be more valuable than uncut items (value +15-25). Hard items cut with scissors should be less valuable (value -15-25).
4. Painted items should be more valuable than unpainted items (value +10-20), but over-painting should make items worse (value -20-30).
5. Natural + artificial combinations should be more valuable than other combinations (value +20-30).
6. Decorations with more than 3 basic items should be less valuable than decorations with fewer than 3 basic items (value -10-20 per extra item).

Think step by step about what the resulting item should be, what its value should be, and what emoji to use.

You are controlling the dynamics of a gene splicing game. Given two animals, or animals and tools, your job is to generate the hybrid or modified animal you get from combining them, along with its value.

BASIC RULES:
1. Each animal has a value (-100 to 100) representing how cool of an animal it is.
2. Basic animals that aren't the product of gene splicing have a value of 2.
3. Tools (growth serum, mutation catalyst, respiratory reconfigurer, metabolic accelerator) are used to modify animals. They always have a value of 0.
4. Combining two tools creates a new, potentially very useful tool. But combining non-basic tools doesn't make anything.
5. Animals can be combined to make new hybrids.

TOOL USE RULES:
1. Growth Serum: Using growth serum on small animals makes them better. It should get a descriptor like "mega" or "giant." Using it on large animals makes them worse. It should get a descriptor like "overgrown" or "deformed."
2. Mutation Catalyst: First mutation makes animals worse. It should get a descriptor like "mutant." Second mutation makes them better. It should get a descriptor like "super" or "enhanced." Third mutation makes them much worse. It should get a descriptor like "corrupted" or "twisted."
3. Respiratory Reconfigurer: Reconfiguring gills to lungs (or vice versa) makes animals worse. It should get a descriptor like "with lungs" or "with gills." Combining reconfigured land/marine animals makes better hybrids. It should get a descriptor like "amphibious" or "dual-breathing."
4. Metabolic Accelerator: Using it on carnivores/omnivores makes them better. It should get a descriptor like "enhanced" or "boosted." Using it on herbivores makes them worse. It should get a descriptor like "malnourished" or "weakened."

COMBINATION RULES:
1. Family Crossing: Combining animals from different families (reptile + mammal) makes better hybrids than combining within the same family.
2. Size Compatibility: Combining animals of similar size makes better hybrids than combining animals of very different sizes.
3. Habitat Compatibility: Combining animals from similar habitats (land + land, water + water) makes better hybrids than combining animals from different habitats.
4. Overcomplication: Hybrids with more than three basic animals get worse.

VALUE RULES:
1. Growth serum on small animals should make them better (value +20-30). Growth serum on large animals should make them worse (value -20-30). Growth serum on medium animals can go either way (value -10 to +10).
2. First mutation should make animals worse (value -20-30). Second mutation should make them better (value +30-40). Third mutation should make them much worse (value -40-50).
3. Respiratory reconfiguration should make animals worse (value -10-20). Combining reconfigured land/marine animals should make better hybrids (value +30-40).
4. Metabolic accelerator on carnivores/omnivores should make them better (value +20-30). Metabolic accelerator on herbivores should make them worse (value -20-30).
5. Cross-family hybrids should be more valuable than same-family hybrids (value +20-30).

2. Basic ingredients that aren't brewed have a potency of 0.
3. Tools (cauldron, mortar, wand, filter) are used to modify ingredients. They always have a potency of 0.

4. Filter: Using filter on liquid ingredients makes them better. It should get a descriptor like "purified" or "filtered." Using it on solid ingredients makes them worse. It should get a descriptor like "drained" or "dry."

COMBINATION RULES:
1. States of Matter: Combining ingredients of different states (liquid + solid, solid + powder) makes better potions than combining ingredients in the same state.
2. Magical-Mundane: Combining magical ingredients (unicorn horn, dragon scale) with mundane ingredients (common herbs, stones) makes better potions than combining two magical or two mundane ingredients.
3. Overcomplication: Potions with more than three basic ingredients get worse.

VALUE RULES:
1. Cauldron on plant ingredients should make them better (potency +20-30). Cauldron on animal ingredients should make them worse (potency -20-30).
