Cut the soft objects once. Paint them all once. Frame them all once. Combine them all.

Paint the hard objects once. Frame them all once. Combine them all.

Then combine the soft and hard at the end.

Sometimes the combining objects that had frames would reduce the score and say it's ruined. Might be better to not frame them until after combining. Didn't have enough time to test that.",2025-09-05 16:33:09.107
