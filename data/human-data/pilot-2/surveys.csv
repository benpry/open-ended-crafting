9312a690-bfa7-4faa-b243-9d4139b4cb73,strategy,I generally tried to see if applying a tool to a single ingredient had a negative or positive impact. If it was a negative impact I would try to go ahead and combine that ingredient with another ingredient before applying another tool to the ingredient. 
9312a690-bfa7-4faa-b243-9d4139b4cb73,enjoyable,"I found this experiment fairly frustrating as it was very hard to find a pattern to the score changes that I was seeing as I was combining ingredients and applying tools. I wish there was a way to find out how each tool impacted the various ingredients, but I guess that's the whole point of this study. "

62f4bbe0-de59-4ca5-a523-2e814cef03a5,strategy,I just tried lots of different combinations to see what would get me higher points. I don't think I did a very good job though.
62f4bbe0-de59-4ca5-a523-2e814cef03a5,enjoyable,I found the experiment frustrating because I don't think I figured out how to maximize my points.

678725f5-3f35-45c8-864b-a54a7e3d951c,enjoyable,I did not find this enjoyable at all because I was terrible at it. I couldn't discern a pattern.
678725f5-3f35-45c8-864b-a54a7e3d951c,feedback,"On one round, the combinations failed to combine multiple times and I got an error message. One finally worked and I was able to continue."

4e18a7fc-163c-40b7-84f7-d41912838250,strategy,"I'm not sure why I kept using the tools when it was already in the negatives because it only made it get worse. At certain points, I kept it simple and that seemed to work OK."
4e18a7fc-163c-40b7-84f7-d41912838250,enjoyable,"I dislked how bad at the strategy I was, but it was enjoyable to take part of."
