e4f1eaeb-14fb-4746-aa49-066dd26d16a2,strategy,I mixed just a few ingredients together. If the points were high from the few I mixed together I would then set the remaining ingredients aside because I had found that mixing everything together gave me much lower points.

0b53f872-6b28-4b16-b55b-a53dbb7daebe,strategy,"Ive played Little Alchemy as a child, so I used that same strategy. I tried to start with only two and add on from there, to see what worked and did not. "
0b53f872-6b28-4b16-b55b-a53dbb7daebe,enjoyable,I thought this was really fun. I wish I would have been able to understand the potions one as good as the animals one!

f98f140b-5801-417b-8560-ad406c1ff2b8,strategy,I mostly got flustered and just devolved into trying to use intuition from using those items in real life.
f98f140b-5801-417b-8560-ad406c1ff2b8,enjoyable,I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not my thing.

04fcbf88-317a-4060-926b-fe3e2a32e368,strategy,"Trial and error combined with common sense. For potions, mortaring gases doesn't make sense, but doing that to solid, hard items does. For animals, combining land and sea animals only works if you correct its breathing problems."
04fcbf88-317a-4060-926b-fe3e2a32e368,enjoyable,It was enjoyable but I would've loved an in-game notes section to keep track of things or some kind of discovery achievement/notification when you figure out something notable. Being on the right track and going too far was frustrating though.
04fcbf88-317a-4060-926b-fe3e2a32e368,feedback,"There were a couple errors that popped up when combining items, but they were temporary and didn't affect play. One error stopped me from submitting, but a retry was successful and I didn't see that error again."
