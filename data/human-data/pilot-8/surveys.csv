bb24d44b-5fee-4708-b86a-bdfbc9495701,strategy,"I made different combinations to figure out what the vial and filter worked with and once I knew that, it was pretty easy to figure out how to get 100pts. "

f5afad64-f02d-4be3-b5ed-24aa102c2a19,enjoyable,Fairly enjoyable. The water function was relatively useless however.
f5afad64-f02d-4be3-b5ed-24aa102c2a19,feedback,No issues! I got screened out once but was able to fix it on my end.

4d0819cf-4ffc-4a86-ae79-38848802b7b7,strategy,Tried to stay awake
4d0819cf-4ffc-4a86-ae79-38848802b7b7,enjoyable,It was repetitive and ultimately predictable. It needs to be shorter or change categories

bf3a8ba7-0106-4ea5-9af2-1bcfd66cb7ff,strategy,I really don't know that I had much of a strategy at all. I just went with the biggest animal and then applied the growth serum. It seemed simple and straightforward and pretty consistent in terms of points.

bf3a8ba7-0106-4ea5-9af2-1bcfd66cb7ff,feedback,No technical problems. Thanks!
3e986777-1e74-48fe-aa3e-3ffe022cb458,strategy,Trial and error.
3e986777-1e74-48fe-aa3e-3ffe022cb458,enjoyable,It was fine but it went on far too long and was probably twice as long as you claimed it would be.
3e986777-1e74-48fe-aa3e-3ffe022cb458,feedback,"I had a few error messages but nothing really bad happened. They seemed to fix themselves. I think I lost an ingredient once, that's all."

d57b8220-24b0-4f7b-9a10-89497e05a5da,strategy,I just tried out a lot of different things to see what happened and what were the best ways to combine things.
d57b8220-24b0-4f7b-9a10-89497e05a5da,enjoyable,"It was fun, but it dragging things back and forth then waiting every time did get tedious."
