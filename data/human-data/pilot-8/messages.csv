Filter or vial one ingredient at a time and combine one ingredient with magical properties with one mundane ingredient to ensure 100 points. I usually only have to combine two items to achieve 100 after I have used the correct tools on each item.

If you have 2 medium grow it twice, or if it's 2 small animals and a medium. If you have 2 large animals, or 1 large and 2 small animals, grow them only once.
